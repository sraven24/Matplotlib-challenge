#  Matplotlib-Challenge

For this challenge, pandas and matplotlib were used to analyze the data from a laboratory study of the effectiveness of cancer medications on the tumors of lab mice.  Using this data, I have written my analysis of the lab data at the top of the Jupyter notebook and created the following charts:
-	An overall summary of the tumor volumes and their statistical variance on each drug regiment
-	A chart showing the number of mice on each regiment.
-	A pie graph showing the split of sexes amongst the total lab mice.
-	A box plot comparing the end volumes of tumors of mice on four specific drugs.
-	A line graph showing the results of one mouse on Capomulin.
-	A scatterplot and line regression model of the weight and average tumor volume of mice on Capomulin

# Installation
Make sure you have the resources folder available with the Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv. Then you should be able to run the code from the pymaceuticals_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter notebook.  You may want to make sure that you are on a Python 3 kernel when running this code.

# Resources
For this project, information was gathered from the homework and external website.  All sources are commented in within the code if it was from a non-homework site.
